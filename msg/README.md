# Messages

Only **message.msg** will be used in our nodes. This will include all messages from this file.

Every main component of main message has a separate file in order to be easier in the future to be changed.

If you want to customize this message just append data to **CUSTOM.msg**. Then access it as *message.custom.your_data*
